#News Classification Web Application
###This project is a news classification web application developed using the Streamlit framework and deployed on Streamlit Cloud. It utilizes a Random Forest machine learning algorithm to automatically categorize news articles into sports, politics, business, and entertainment.

##Overview
###The News Classification Web Application is designed to assist users in categorizing news articles based on their content. The application uses a trained Random Forest model, which achieves a high accuracy rate of 97% on the classification task.

##Methodology
###The development of the News Classification Web Application followed a structured data science project lifecycle, which includes the following phases:


##Data Collection
###Gather relevant data sources that will be used to train and test the machine learning model. This involves obtaining datasets containing news articles and their respective categories.

##Data Preprocessing
###Clean and preprocess the collected data to prepare it for model training. This includes:

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
Stemming: Reducing words to their root form.
Stopwords Removal: Eliminating common words that do not contribute to the classification.
Text Vectorization: Using the Bag-of-Words model to convert text into numerical features.
##Model Selection and Training
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) for the classification task. Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets, and train the model using the training data.

##Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall). Fine-tune the model parameters if necessary to achieve optimal performance. The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy rate of 97%.

##Web Application Development
Utilize the trained model to develop the news classification web application using the Streamlit framework. Design an intuitive user interface that allows users to input news articles and view classification results.

##Deployment
Deploy the web application on a hosting platform such as Streamlit Cloud to make it accessible to users over the internet.


##Technologies Used
Streamlit: Frontend framework used to build the web application.
Python: Programming language used for the backend development.
Random Forest: Machine learning algorithm employed for news classification.
Streamlit Cloud: Hosting platform used to deploy the web application.
